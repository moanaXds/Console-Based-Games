ðŸ§© Recursive Maze Solver (Console-Based Game Component)
-------------------------------------------------------

This project implements a console-based maze generator and solver using recursion in C++. The maze is dynamically allocated in memory, randomly filled with walls and paths, and solved step by step using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach.

The program demonstrates:
------------------------

Recursive maze generation

Recursive maze pathfinding (DFS)

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation of a 2D array

A fully text-based game-style interface

ðŸŽ¯ Features
-----------

ðŸ”¹ Random Maze Generation: Maze is filled with walls (0) and paths (1) with a random distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Memory Allocation: The maze is created dynamically using new and fully deallocated at the end.

ðŸ”¹ Recursive Maze Solver: Uses DFS recursion to find a path from the Start (S) to the Exit (E).

ðŸ”¹ Path Visualization: Once solved, the path is marked with P.

ðŸ”¹ Console-Based Gameplay Component: Great for embedding into larger console-based puzzle or adventure games.
